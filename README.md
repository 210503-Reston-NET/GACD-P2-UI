# Kwik Koder

Many coders are bottlenecked by lackluster typing skills, we aim to provide these developers with a place to hone their abilities and improve themselves.

Users can test their limits in over 60 different programming languages.

Users can see how they stand against others with overall as well as category specific leaderboards.

Users can compete against their friends in competitions.

We reward users with revapoints through competition participation, and provide them with eye catching graphs that show their progress over time.
